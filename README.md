# vue-nest-calendar-app

The contents of this repo were created by Michał Gagoś. It contains the main assignment for a collage course called **Web Development Frameworks**.

As the name suggests it uses `nest.js` for the backend and `vue` for the frontend.

To start the application run it using docker
```
docker compose up
```

This will expose the frontend under `localhost:8080`
